When you see this instruction, you're in a customized fork repo branch.

# Changes convention

Changes in this branch are drop-in diff commits staying on top of the upstream branch.

The long-term maintenance pattern is: over time, keep calling `git pull origin main` to rebase the branch commits on top of the latest upstream code.

Thus, the design of the changes target to minimize the potentials of future rebase conflicts.
